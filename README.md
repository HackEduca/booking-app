### What does each page do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The App starts with a Login Page. This page let's user register or Login. A user must register to use the app.


**_The Places Page_** -   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Places Page is the first page to be displayed after a user logs in. It has Two child pages, the **_Discover Page_** and the **_Offers Page_** which are displayed in tabs.


**_The Discover Page (Find Places)_** -

If the user wants to rent the place, he can click on the Book Button which brings up the booking modal (The modal is created by _create booking_ component in bookings folder).


**_The Offers Page_** -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offers Page allows user to rent out his own places/ rooms to other people. A user can list out his place using the add (plus) icon located on the top right corner which brings up the **_New Offer Page_**. The Offers place also displays a list of current offerings by the user. Tapping on an offer leads to the **_Offer Bookings Page_**.


**_The New Offer Page_** -  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page allows an user to list out a new place available for bookings by other users.


**_The Edit Offer Page_** -

## To run Locally


Clone this Repository
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/reuelrds/booking-app
> cd booking-app
```

Install npm dependencies
```bash
> npm install
```

**Note -** Before you proceed forward read [Project Setup](#project-setup)  
&nbsp;

Start the Ionic application in a new Terminal from project root directory
```bash
> npm run start
```

Open the Developer Tools and Click on Toggle Device Toolbar. Select a device from the list of devices.  

**Note -** When Switching between IOS and Android Devices, after selecting a device make sure to refresh the browser. _(This will let ionic render the app with the native styling)_ 

### Building the App
---

```bash
> npm run build:android
```
This copies the files from the www folder _(This folder is generated by the above command or by running `npm run build`)_ to the **_android/app/src/main/assets/public_** folder.

**The _android_ folder is an Android project and can be opened in the Android Studio to debug or generate an apk file or add some additional native functionality.**


**Note -** If you are facing any problems running the above npm scripts, install angular cli and ionic cli globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli` and `npm install -g ionic` respectively and run `ionic serve` to launch the app in a browser. To Build the app use `ng build --prod && ionic capacitor copy android` to create an Android Studio project which can be used to preivew the app on an emulator or a physical device and also generate the apk.  

## Project Setup
